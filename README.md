# About
This started as a project for Ludum Dare 48, but now it's just a general template for all of my games.
Depends on [my fork of javascript-state-machine](https://github.com/woooowoooo/javascript-state-machine).

# Structure
- `index.html` and `style.css` contain the boilerplate framing around the canvas
- `game.js` contains the state machine and the game loop
- `index.js` contains the initial setup and some helper functions
- `tetris.js` contains the game logic
- `images/`, `sounds/` and `fonts/` contain the assets
